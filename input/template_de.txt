#thumbnail_prompt: Create a clean, professional YouTube thumbnail with a soft, natural background and clear, realistic imagery. Show one or two animals from the list (such as an elephant or lion) in high-quality, natural-looking photography. Avoid using collages. The focus should be on realism and simplicity. Add bold, white text with a black outline that says "15 AMAZING ANIMALS IN SIMPLE German" in the center. Use large typography (at least 60px), and place the channel name "World of Languages" at the bottom in smaller white text (24‚Äì30px) with black outline. Use subtle depth of field and soft lighting to make the text pop without overpowering the animals. The composition should feel calm, clear, and professional ‚Äî like a high-end educational thumbnail.

#images_scenario:
- section: intro
  prompt: Create a realistic nature scene showing several animals in separate natural settings ‚Äî such as a lion in savanna, a penguin on ice, and a panda in a bamboo forest. Avoid symmetrical or grid layouts. Each animal should appear naturally within its habitat, not grouped or collaged. Use soft depth of field, natural lighting, and high-quality, realistic photographic style. The scene should feel like a calm nature documentary, with no artificial compositions. Maintain a 16:9 aspect ratio, and ensure all animals are shown clearly and in proportion, each in their own space.
