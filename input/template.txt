<mark name="elephant_start"/>Let's start with the elephant. Elephants are very big animals. They are gray and have long trunks. Elephants use their trunks to pick up food and water. They have big ears and tusks too. Elephants live in Africa and Asia. They eat plants and can weigh up to 13,000 pounds!<mark name="elephant_end"/>

<mark name="lion_start"/>Next is the lion. Lions are strong animals with golden fur. Male lions have a big mane around their head. Lions live in groups called prides. They eat meat and can run very fast. Lions are sometimes called the "king of the jungle."<mark name="lion_end"/>

<mark name="penguin_start"/>Now let's learn about penguins. Penguins are birds that cannot fly. They have black and white feathers. Penguins live in very cold places like Antarctica. They swim very well and eat fish. Penguins walk in a funny way that makes people smile.<mark name="penguin_end"/>

<mark name="giraffe_start"/>Our fourth animal is the giraffe. Giraffes are the tallest animals in the world. They have very long necks and legs. Giraffes have brown spots on their fur. They eat leaves from tall trees. A giraffe's tongue can be up to 21 inches long!<mark name="giraffe_end"/>

<mark name="dolphin_start"/>Finally, let's talk about dolphins. Dolphins live in the ocean. They are very smart animals. Dolphins have a special hole on top of their head for breathing.
